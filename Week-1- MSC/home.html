        <h2>National Cadet Corps (NCC) and Student Activities</h2>
        <p>At Maris Stella College, we encourage our students to participate in various extracurricular activities such as the National Cadet Corps (NCC) and student-run clubs. The NCC program provides an excellent platform for leadership, discipline, and nation-building, while student clubs offer a creative and collaborative environment for learning and growth.</p>
        <p>Our NCC cadets participate in various activities such as drills, camps, and community service. It not only enhances physical fitness but also fosters a sense of responsibility and patriotism.</p>
        <p>Students actively engage in cultural, technical, sports, and literary clubs. These activities help to nurture creativity, teamwork, and leadership skills, allowing students to grow beyond academics and become well-rounded individuals.</p>
